# Turn an MP3 file into a live audio broadcast with Icecast on CentOS

My goal is to broadcast an MP3 encoded audio file at a specific time on a specific IP address so that anyone who has the IP address can connect at that time and hear the broadcast.

To keep cost and complexity manageable :

  * The server is a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform
  * The server is created specifically for the broadcast
  * The server is deleted immediately after the broadcast
  * Open source software is used to broadcast the audio
  * Content is created for the broadcast ahead of time

Check your content file, audio.mp3

## Set up a server

Create a server with CentOS 7 and configure the network to enable TCP and UDP traffic on port 8000.  On GCP this means setting a network tag ```icecast-8000``` on the virtual machine and creating a new firewall rule to allow TCP and UDP traffic on port 8000 to servers tagged ```icecast-8000``` :

    Name : icecast-8000
    Logs : Off
    Direction of traffic : ingress
    Action on match : Allow
    Targets : Specified target tags
    Target tags : icecast-8000
    Source filter : IP ranges
    Source IP ranges : 0.0.0.0/0
    Second source filter : None
    Protocols and ports : Specified protocols and ports
    [x] tcp 8000
    [x] udp 8000

Other cloud providers will have different ways to accomplish this

## Install and configure Icecast and EZStream on CentOS 7

Update the server

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum update -y

Open the firewall for port 800 TCP and port 8000 UDP

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/udp
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Check the firewall configuration

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all # Expect ports: 8000/tcp 8000/udp

Test connectivity by setting up netcat as a listener on port 8000

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum -y install nmap-ncat
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo nc -l 8000

Open a new session to the server and make sure netcat is really listening

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo netstat -plunt | grep \:8000
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12518/nc
    tcp6       0      0 :::8000                 :::*                    LISTEN      12518/nc

From your local machine, connect to netcat on the Icecast server

    [you@laptop ~]$ curl 35.222.4.30:8000

Netcat will show the connection on the server

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: 35.222.4.30:8000
    User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
    Accept: */*

Stop cURL on your laptop with ^C and netcat will stop on the server

Install Icecast and EZStream

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum install -y icecast ezstream

Upload your audio

    [you@laptop ~]$ scp audio.mp3 you@server:.

Edit the Icecast configuration file at /etc/icecast.xml and set

  * source password to a value of your choice
  * relay password to a value of your choice
  * admin user to a value of your choice
  * admin password to a value of your choice
  * hostname to the external IP addresss of your server
  * bind-address to 0.0.0.0

Start Icecast

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl enable icecast
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl start icecast

Check that Icecast started

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl status icecast
    ● icecast.service - Icecast Network Audio Streaming Server
       Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/icecast.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
       Active: active (running) since Sat 2020-03-21 09:18:02 UTC; 4s ago
    Mar 21 09:18:02 blueroom-broadcast systemd[1]: Started Icecast Network Audio Streaming Server.

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo netstat -plunt | grep icecast
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12980/icecast

From your local machine, check that the Icecast server responds to TCP requests with a 200 OK status code

    [you@laptop ~]$ curl --write-out '%{http_code}\n' --output /dev/null --silent 35.222.4.30:8000
    200

Create a playlist at ~/playlist.m2u

    [you@icecast ~]$ echo audio.mp3 > playlist.m3u

Create an EZStream configuration file at ~/ezstream.xml, defining

  * source password
  * server information name
  * server information URL
  * server information genre
  * server information description

Your EZStream configuration file might end up looking like

    <ezstream>
      <url>http://35.222.4.30:8000/stream</url>
      <sourcepassword>XXXXXXXXXXXX</sourcepassword>
      <format>MP3</format>
      <filename>playlist.m3u</filename>
      <stream_once>1</stream_once>
      <svrinfoname>XXXXXXXX</svrinfoname>
      <svrinfourl>XXXXXXXX</svrinfourl>
      <svrinfogenre>XXXXXXXX</svrinfogenre>
      <svrinfodescription>XXXXXXXX</svrinfodescription>
      <svrinfobitrate>128</svrinfobitrate>
      <svrinfochannels>2</svrinfochannels>
      <svrinfosamplerate>44100</svrinfosamplerate>
      <svrinfopublic>0</svrinfopublic>
    </ezstream>

Configure the permissions of the EZStream configuration file at ~/exstream.xml so that it is not writeable by world or group

    [you@icecast ~]$ chmod g-w ezstream.xml

To start your broadcast, start EZStream

    [you@icecast ~]$ ezstream -c ezstram.xml

When the playlist has been broadcast, EZStream will quit and you can destroy the server

## Providing a link to the broadcast at the right time

Provide a web server and a link to the stream

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum install -y httpd
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo sed -i'' 's/^/\#/' /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf
    [you@icecast ~]$ echo '<a href="http://35.222.4.30:8000/stream.m3u">Tune in</a>' | sudo tee index.html &> /dev/null
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl enable httpd
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl start httpd

Provide a countdown timer that turns into a link

    <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="hold">Broadcast launch link will appear here in <span id="time"></span></div>
    <a style="display:none;" href="http://35.222.4.30:8000/stream.m3u" id='launch'>Tune in</a>
    <script>
    function start(duration, display) {
      console.log( 'start' );
      var timer = duration, minutes, seconds;
      setInterval(function () {
        minutes = parseInt( timer / 60, 10 );
        seconds = parseInt( timer % 60, 10 );
        minutes = minutes < 10 ? "0" + minutes : minutes;
        seconds = seconds < 10 ? "0" + seconds : seconds;
        display.textContent = minutes + ':' + seconds;
        if ( --timer < 0 ) {
          document.getElementById('hold').style.display = 'none';
          document.getElementById('launch').style.display = 'inline';
        }
      }, 1000);
    }
    window.onload = function () {
      var current = new Date();
      var activate = new Date( 'Sat Mar 21 2020 17:00:05 GMT+0000' );
      var diff = activate - current;
      var seconds = parseInt( diff / 1000 );
      var display = document.getElementById("time");
      start(seconds, display);
    };
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>

## Launching the broadcast

You can do this manually

    [you@icecast ~]$ ezstream -c ezstream.xml

or you can have the operating system do it for you

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum install -y at
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl enable atd
    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo systemctl start atd
    [you@icecast ~]$ ezstream -c ezstram.xml | at 17:00

The ```at``` command only knows about minutes, so make the Javascript timer activate the link a few seconds later to give ezstream time to start up

## Connecting to the broadcast

With VLC or similar audio client open a connection to the broadcast

    http://35.222.4.30:8000/stream.m3u

## Helping listeners

Naming and tagging your MP3 file properly helps audio clients display appropriate information to the listeners

Keep an eye on your server performance

    [you@icecast ~]$ sudo yum install -y glances
    [you@icecast ~]$ glances
