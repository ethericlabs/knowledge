# An evening with Uncle Bob Martin

We know that back in the 1940s there were not many programmers. Alan Turing and Countess Ada Lovelace might have starred each other's projects on GitHub but it didn't exist. Now there might be 100,000,000 programmers ?  Some thing like that ?

Mathematically, the curve that gets is from 1 in 1940 to 100,000,000 in 2020 is the one where the number of programmers doubles every five years.

Half of the programmers in the world have less than five years of experience. If you've been programming for longer, consider the quality of code you wrote in those first five years.

Code used to be obviously contained in huge, prohibitively expensive specialist machinery in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, 70s.  Those cathedrals of computation are many magnitudes less capable then the average mobile phone.

If you wanted to retro-engineering the trillions of transistors in your phone with vacuum tubes you'd need enough space to park 2,500 Nimitz class aircraft carriers, a terrawatt of power and a budget of around 50 trillion dollars.  Now, you can sign a contract in a High Street store and keep it in your pocket.

Code is soaked into the fabric of the manufactured world.  Not in the obvious places like laptops and phones or the spreadsheets and bank transfers but physically around us in the lightbulbs, fire alarms and in really important things like brakes and sensors.

Despite the phenomenal evolution of hardware, code hasn't evolved much at all.  It's just become microscopically pervasive and disarmingly out of sight.

When software errors have real-world legal consequences, we know that it is the programmers rather than the board who will be blamed.  From the court's perspecive the cause of the accident is the commit, not the pressure to get the product to market.  Like the medical profession before us, programmers have the opportunity to self-regulate before governments try to help.

> It  will  be  seen  that  the  possibilities  as  to  what  one  may  do  are  immense.  One  of  our  difficulties  will  be  the  maintainence  of  an  appropriate  discipline,  so  that  we  do  not  lose  track  of  what  we  are  doing.  We  shall  need  a  number  of  efficient  librarian types to keep us in order... We  shall need a great number of mathematicians of ability.
